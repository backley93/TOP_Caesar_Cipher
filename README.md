# TOP_Caesar_Cipher
Ceasar Cipher project for The Odin Project
This method creates a Caesar Cipher using the Ruby programming language. First the method takes a string and number as a parameter.
The method shifts each character in the string to the number associated with a letter in the alphabet (eg: A = 1 shifts to D = 4 due to
a shift_num of 3). The method then returns a new string with the shifted letters. Only letter based characters are affected.
